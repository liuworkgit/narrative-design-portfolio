# Narrative Design Portfolio
A collection of all of my writing and narrative design works, specifically for game development.

## *Mnemosyne*
*Mnemosyne* is a hypothetical 3D-platformer in which you play as a prisoner of Mnemosyne, a prison located in an underwater dimension. Stripped of your memories, you resolve to escape the prison before you fade away for good.

This was written for UBC's CRWR 310 Video Game Writing and Narrative course.

## *Deep Down* VR Experience
*Deep Down* is a VR game/experience where the player is a researcher who must brave the crushing depths to reach safety while being hunted by a monster.

This was written for UBC's CRWR 213 Introduction to Writing for New Media course.
